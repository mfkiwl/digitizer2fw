# Digitizer2 TDC firmware
The digitizer2 project is a low-cost, high speed analog-to-digital converter with customizable signal processing logic.

Firmware
---
The primary application of the digitizer is pulse detection and time-to-digital conversion of analog signals and digital trigger processing. All necessary control logic is implemented using the onboard FPGA. The firmware contains logic for host-communication, system control, analog and digital signal processing and data acquisition.
